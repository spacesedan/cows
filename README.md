# Cows!

## **Purpose**

The Purpose of the app was to learn how to use Wordpress as a Headless CMS. I am interested in the JAM stack, when I learned that I could leverage Wordpress's platform as a way to create custom webpages without the need of a pre-installed themes, and I wanted to know how. With the use a plugin called WPGraphQL I was able to hook into my Wordpress database and gain access to its data, allowing me to display it on a Next.js project. The reason for the theme of the website, I usually go for a placeholder image of a cow, and that was the inspiration for the app. I was able to style it using Tailwind CSS, which made it easier to build the application.

## **Challenges**

The biggest challenge with this project was learning how to use GraphQL. I was not familiar with how to use it, after reading some documentation I learned its benefit's when it came to fetching data from an API. Another challenge was styling the site, I didn't want to use a component library and instead I opted to use Tailwind CSS a library that I wasn 't familiar with. After using it on this app, I really liked how easily you could style a custom components.
